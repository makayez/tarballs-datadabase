### Changed
- Sound effects now only play when Test button is clicked (not on dropdown selection)
- Replaced long sound effects with shorter ones suitable for raid announcements
- About tab now appears first in the configuration panel (before Settings)
- All tab buttons widened to 120-130px for better text display
- Configuration panel height increased to 650px to prevent content overlap
- Module enable checkbox now always active (allows configuration when globally disabled)
- Module tab controls now gray out dynamically when module is disabled (in addition to global disable)
- `/dadabase say` and `/dadabase guild` commands now ignore trigger and group settings, only respecting module enabled state
- `/dadabase status` command now formatted better with statistics included
- Content storage system now tracks only user changes (additions/deletions) instead of full content arrays
- Default content is now stored in addon code rather than SavedVariables
- Configuration UI replaced scrollable list with individual delete buttons with a text editor
- SavedVariables structure now uses `userAdditions` and `userDeletions` arrays
- DB versioning now preserves user deletions (deleted jokes stay deleted on upgrade)
- Debug output now properly conditional (no spam in chat on load)
- All magic numbers replaced with named constants
- README updated to reflect all new features

### Fixed
- Sound effect test button now properly plays sounds using numeric SOUNDKIT IDs
- Corrected sound effect IDs (removed incorrect ones causing voice lines)
- Personal death trigger now works when solo (not just in groups)
- Personal death trigger no longer requires group checkboxes to be enabled
- Guild Quotes text editor now accepts input (removed from disabled controls)
- Manual commands (`/dadabase say`, `/dadabase guild`) no longer return "dadabase is empty" when modules are enabled but triggers/groups are not configured
- Race condition in SendContent that could bypass cooldown
- Message length validation prevents exceeding WoW's 255 character limit
- Memory leak from recreating tooltip handlers on every refresh
- Empty contentPool now returns valid moduleId instead of nil
- Content management now handles large datasets (1100+ items) efficiently with caching
- New default content in updates automatically appears without restoring deleted items
- SavedVariables file size reduced significantly for users with default content

### Technical
- `GetEffectiveContent()` function merges defaults with user changes at runtime with caching
- Content cache automatically invalidates on any content modification
- `SetEffectiveContent()` includes comprehensive type validation and error handling
- `GetRandomContent()` now returns both content and moduleId for prefix handling
- `GetRandomContent()` supports optional `ignoreTriggers` parameter for manual commands
- `GetContentPrefix()` function generates dynamic prefixes with 108 randomized adjectives
- Input sanitization strips WoW formatting codes (colors, hyperlinks, textures, encrypted text)
- Race condition prevention in SendContent using pendingMessage flag
- Math.random properly seeded for better randomness
- All magic numbers replaced with named constants
- Tooltip handlers reused instead of recreated to prevent memory leaks
- Backward compatibility maintained for legacy functions

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Statistics tracking showing content count and times told per module
- Statistics now increment for manual commands (`/dadabase say`, `/dadabase guild`)
- Sound effects with dropdown selection (17 different WoW sounds available)

- About tab with usage instructions, GitHub link, and thank you message
- Tooltips on disabled controls explaining addon is globally disabled or module is disabled
- Clarifying help text for cooldown setting explaining its behavior
- Multi-line text editor for content management (one item per line)
- Save Changes button with visual feedback in configuration UI
- Save Changes button now disabled until content is actually edited
- Reset to Defaults button to clear all user customizations
- Dynamic prefixes for all content types with 100 randomized adjectives
  - Dad Jokes: "And now, for a [adjective] dad joke: "
  - Demotivational: "And now, for a [adjective] motivational quote: "
  - Guild Quotes: "And now, for some [adjective] famous words from a friend: "
- Automatic grammar handling (a/an) based on adjective
- 32 additional demotivational sayings
- Migration system for existing SavedVariables data

### Changed
- About tab now appears first in the configuration panel (before Settings)
- All tab buttons widened to 120-130px for better text display
- Configuration panel height increased to 650px to prevent content overlap
- Module tab controls now gray out dynamically when module is disabled (in addition to global disable)
- `/dadabase say` and `/dadabase guild` commands now ignore trigger and group settings, only respecting module enabled state
- Content storage system now tracks only user changes (additions/deletions) instead of full content arrays
- Default content is now stored in addon code rather than SavedVariables
- Configuration UI replaced scrollable list with individual delete buttons with a text editor
- SavedVariables structure now uses `userAdditions` and `userDeletions` arrays
- README updated to reflect new change-tracking system

### Fixed
- Sound effect test button now properly plays sounds using numeric SOUNDKIT IDs
- Personal death trigger now works when solo (not just in groups)
- Personal death trigger no longer requires group checkboxes to be enabled
- Manual commands (`/dadabase say`, `/dadabase guild`) no longer return "dadabase is empty" when modules are enabled but triggers/groups are not configured
- Content management now handles large datasets (1000+ items) efficiently
- New default content in updates automatically appears without restoring deleted items
- SavedVariables file size reduced significantly for users with default content

### Technical
- `GetEffectiveContent()` function merges defaults with user changes at runtime
- `SetEffectiveContent()` function diffs editor content to determine additions/deletions
- `GetRandomContent()` now returns both content and moduleId for prefix handling
- `GetContentPrefix()` function generates dynamic prefixes with randomized adjectives
- Backward compatibility maintained for legacy functions

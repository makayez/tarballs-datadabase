# Changelog

All notable changes to Tarball's Dadabase will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Maximum global cooldown increased from 60 seconds to 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Settings panel integration redesigned - Options > Addons > Tarball's Dadabase now shows a simple panel with a button to open the full configuration dialog

### Fixed
- Config panel toggle bug when switching between `/dadabase` command and Options menu (now uses IsVisible() instead of IsShown())
- Tab button positioning now uses absolute positioning for consistent layout regardless of display method
- Config panel no longer attempts to embed in Settings window, preventing button overflow and display issues

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Custom prefix support per module (enable/disable, custom text input with 50 character limit)
- Automatic message splitting for long content (messages >255 chars split at word boundaries with 1.5s delay between chunks)
- Visual divider separating auto-save settings from manual-save content editor
- Content Editor section clearly labeled with explicit save instructions
- Save Changes and Reset to Defaults buttons now contained within editor frame with divider line
- Buttons disabled until text changes are detected (clearer UX for what requires saving)
- Helper functions for dynamic tab positioning (CreateTabButton) and control state management (SetControlState)
- Consolidated SanitizeText utility function for input sanitization

### Changed
- Simplified triggers UI by removing "Personal death" option (only wipe triggers remain)
- Combined trigger and group sections into single "Trigger on wipes in:" section
- Reduced randomized adjectives from 110 to 40 most fitting options
- Renamed "Saved Variables (legacy)" section to "Global Settings" for clarity
- Changed "Content" label to "Content Editor" to emphasize editor functionality
- Updated instructions text to explicitly mention "Save Changes" button
- Extracted sound options to SOUND_OPTIONS constant for easier maintenance
- Tab button positioning now uses dynamic helper function instead of hard-coded offsets

### Fixed
- **Critical:** Taint issue causing "blocked from Blizzard UI action" error (removed C_Timer.After from single message sending)
- **Critical:** Race condition in multi-message splits (now validates group still exists before sending delayed messages)
- **Critical:** Message splitting edge cases (empty chunks, infinite loops, proper word-boundary detection)
- Removed dead code: 3 unused legacy functions (AddContent, RemoveContent, GetContent) - 43 lines removed
- Removed orphaned death trigger logic from Database.lua after PLAYER_DEAD event was removed
- Message splitting now accounts for prefix length in total message size calculation

### Technical
- Message splitting with smart word-boundary detection (searches for spaces/punctuation within last 50 chars)
- Group validation in C_Timer callbacks prevents errors when player leaves group during multi-message send
- Consolidated all sanitization logic into single DB:SanitizeText() function (DRY principle)
- Trigger logic simplified: module enabled + group match = triggers (no longer checks triggers.wipe)
- RefreshControls function reduced from 58 to 38 lines using SetControlState helper
- Added safety limits to message splitting (max 20 iterations, progress detection)
- Removed SetModuleTrigger() function (dead code, never called)
- Removed triggers from module defaultSettings (new installs don't need them)
- Triggers field preserved in existing SavedVariables for backward compatibility but no longer used
